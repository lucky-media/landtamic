When you edit a page on the control panel, you can see that each page has the SEO section in the entry editor. For SEO we use our own SEO called LuckySEO which you can read about it below this section.

* Meta

  * Title prepend - Prepends to title the text set in General SEO settings.
  * Title append - Appends to title the text set in General SEO settings.
  * Meta Description - It can be used to determine the text used under the title on search engine results pages. If empty, search engines will automatically generate this text.
  * Canonical - By default it will be set to the page url.
* Social
  * Open Graph Title
  * Open Graph Description
  * Twitter Title
  * Twitter Description
  * OG Image - If not set, the general image will be used.

### LuckySEO
By default we use our own LuckySEO which comes together with the kit. You can control your SEO general settings here. Make sure to read the instructions on each input. This settings can be overridden on specific entries/pages as shown on the SEO section above.

* Meta
  * Title - While the title tag doesn’t start with "meta," it is in the header and contains information that's very important to SEO. You should always have a unique title tag on every page that describes the page.
  * Prepend on Title - This will be PREPENDED to all of the titles.
  * Append on Title - This will be APPENDED to all of the titles.
  * Meta Description - It is used for one major purpose: to describe the page to searchers as they read through the SERPs. Can be overridden on pages, if left blank, search engines will generate their own content for this field.
* Social
  * Image - Use your logo or any other branded image for the rest of your pages. 
  * Display Open Graph tags - Open Graph meta tags are snippets of code that control how URLs are displayed when shared on social media.
  * Site name
  * Title - Keep it short to prevent overflow. 40 characters for mobile and 60 for desktop is roughly the sweet spot. Use the raw title.
  * Description - General Description, can be overridden on specific pages. Complement the title to make the snippet as appealing and click-worthy as possible. Copy your meta description here if it makes sense. Keep it short and sweet. Facebook recommends 2–4 sentences, but that often truncates.
  * Display Twitter Tags - Title, Handle and Description

## Styling
The design of Landtamic is done entirely with TailwindCSS. We have added many different colors on the Tailwind Config file and you can change the primary colors to make a different color combination for your website.

  * Font Family - default is sans: Manrope.
  * Colors - primary, secondary, info color names because it makes it easier to apply different colors..
